### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning using various ML libraries and frameworks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning
- I am a google certified TensorFlow Developer

- From November 2022 I have been exploring and learning a lot in the field of Machine Learning.
- I have worked on 100+ personal projects in Regression, Classification, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models as part of my learning process
- I have learned and experimented on successful open source models using open source and custom datasets.
- I have implemented various algorithms on Supervised and Un-supervised learning.
- I can build, train, evaluate and deploy models with ease.
- I have deployed Large Language Models in Hugging Face spaces.
- I am familiar with analysis tools such as WandB, tensorboard

- My primary Machine Learning Skills include SciKit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, Onnx, Keras
